## What is the CPES Data Science, Society and Health?

The CPES (Multidisciplinary Cycle of Higher Education) "Data Science, Society and Health" is a selective post-baccalaureate program that combines the rigor of preparatory classes with the academic openness of universities and grandes écoles.

Students validate an institutional diploma conferring a **bachelor's degree** (Licence - Bac+3 level), jointly awarded by **Université Paris-Saclay**, **Institut Polytechnique de Paris** and **HEC Paris** (Decree n° 2023-937 of October 10, 2023).

The cohort is kept to a manageable size: approximately **48 students** per year.

## The two specialization tracks

From the first year, after a common core, students choose a specialization that will guide their projects and certain subjects:

### 1. Data Science & Health 🧬
This track is intended for students interested in AI and data applications in the biomedical field, public health and biology. It covers subjects such as genomics, immunology or epidemiology.

### 2. Data Science & Society ⚖️
This track links data science to humanities and social sciences. It addresses social relationships, stratification, cultures and their diversity.

## A progressive 3-year structure

The program is designed for a smooth transition to higher education and research. The course location evolves each year:

* **1st year (L1)**: 
    * **80%** of classes at the Lycée International (LIPPS).
    * **20%** at partner institutions (ENS Paris-Saclay, Telecom Paris, etc.).
    * *Objective:* Acquire fundamentals and working methods.
* **2nd year (L2)**:
    * **50%** at LIPPS / **50%** with partners.
    * *Objective:* Beginning of specialization, research projects and immersion.
* **3rd year (L3)**:
    * **30%** at LIPPS / **70%** with partners.
    * *Objective:* Autonomy, final "Capstone" project and preparation for Master's programs.
